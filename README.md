# Rail Fence Cipher and Decipher
- This repository consists python implementation of the __Rail Fence__ Symmetric Encryption Algorithm 

### Description and information about the algorithm:
- The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that rearranges the plaintext letters by writing them in a zigzag pattern across multiple "rails" or lines, then reading off the ciphertext row by row. The number of rails determines the height of the zigzag pattern.
This repository provides a Python implementation of both the Rail Fence Cipher and its corresponding Decipher algorithm.

### Key Differentiator : Deciphering Method
- The deciphering method used in this implementation is simple and __~2x more efficient__ than the other implementations available online
